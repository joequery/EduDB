Purpose
-------

EduDB aims to provide a simple interface for allowing SQL novices to practice
creating queries to solve problems.

The current overhead involved in teaching SQL includes:

* Installing database systems onto the machines of students
* Connecting database management programs to database systems
* Connecting the language of choice to the database system

When introducing a student to SQL, it's my opinion that students should be able
to quickly perform basic queries and interact with the results without setup
complications interfering with the first few lessons. After a general
understanding of basic SQL is reached, students can then be introduced to
interacting with databases the standard way (since they will now understand why
it's worth the trouble)
